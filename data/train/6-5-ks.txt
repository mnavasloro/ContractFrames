On January 1, 2018, 'personB' made a contract to sell 'this_real_estate' to 'personA'.
But 'personA' canceled this contract on 1 March 2018 because 'personA' is a minor.
This cancellation is due to 'personB' obsessing 'personA' on 1 February 2018  because 'personB' wants to sell this_real_estate to 'personC' at the higher price.
